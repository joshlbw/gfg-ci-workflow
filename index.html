    <h1> Are we having NMP Scheme as a Revolving Door to MPs in Singapore?</h1>
    <p>The Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme in Singapore is designed to ensure a minimum
        representation of opposition voices in Parliament, even if they do not win enough seats in general elections.
        The scheme allows the best-performing losing opposition candidates to be offered NCMP seats, thereby providing
        them with a platform to participate in parliamentary debates and contribute to the legislative process.</p>
    <h1> Jeremy Tan and Darryl Lo are eloquent but they will be questioned if they became MP, through the NPM scheme
        eventually.</h1>
        <h1> WE HAVE FINALLY REACHED THE END OF THIS SCTP</h1>
